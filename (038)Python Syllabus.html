PYTHON DATA TYPES AND SYSTEM DEFINED FUNCTIONS:

This section of python comprises of the system related concepts like data types, system-defined functions with practical implementations. System Module concept. how to import the system defined modules and its uses.

Python Data types like Numbers , Strings , Lists , Tuples , Dictionaries etc
difference between Normal and module function eg math , random.

Number functions: The functions which works on the number inputs are number functions. This section also comprise system defined number functions .
abs , max , min
math.ceil , math.floor , round,
random functions lile : choice , shuffle , randrange , uniform

String Functions and string Operators:
The functions which work on the string inputs are number functions. This section also comprises system defined string functions.
string operators like + , * , [] , [:] , in , not in
case related functions like capitalize , upper , lower , title , swapcase
max , min , len
ljust , rjust , center , lstrip , rstrip , strip
count , index , find , replace
split , join , startswith , endswith , reversed , sorted
validation functions like isalpha , isdigit , isalnum , isupper , islower

Lists, operators, and functions: This section comprises of the list concepts such as operators and functions. List are the part and parcel when it comes dealing with files. This section also includes Indexing , creation , manipulation and deletion for the lists.
practical implementations with files using lists.
List operators + , * , [] , [:] , in , not in
List fundtions like len , max , min
append , extend , index , insert , pop
deep copy and shallow copy
remove , sort , reverse
map , reduce , filter

Tuple, Operators and functions : Tuples are immutable list . Here we deal with the difference between lists and tuples . Importance of the tuples over the list, Indexing , access and deletion of the tuples.
tuple operators + , * , [] , [:] , in , not in
difference between list and tuple
tuple functions len , max , min , copy
map , reduce , filter

Dictionary operators and Functions: Here we know about the key – value pairs. Has concepts . User defined indexing and its importance over the system defined indexes used in lists and tuples along with the Dictionary operators and functions.
Difference between list and dictionary
dictionary operators like [] , in , not in
dictionary functions like len , keys , values , items ,
get , fromkeys , setdefault

USER-DEFINED CONCEPTS :

In the above section 2, we seen every function or module used is system defined. This section mainly focuses on user-defined elements like user-defined functions, types of user-defined functions and its importance. Return statement. user-defined modules how can user-defined modules are imported etc.


Exception Handling: This section consists of handilng the exceptions using try and except block. Importance of the word Exception and system defined exceptions. User defined exceptions its importance. assert statement.
try , except block
System defined exceotions
User defined exception
assert statement
finally block

Files: This section is for creation, reading and writing of the files which are Ascii files , binary files etc except non ASCII files like pdf , excel files. Creation , deletion, Read , write and append operations in files.
file handlers
file functions like open , read , readline , readlines , write , writeline , writelines , close , seek , tell
file modes like r, w, a, r+, w+, a+, rb, wb, ab

User-Defined Functions: here we deal with user defined fucntions its types based on how arguments passed. Importance of the return statement.
difference between user defined and system defined functions
types of user defined functions like
Required and positional arguments
required and nonpositional Keyword arguments
default arguments

user-defined modules:
This section includes Importance of the user defined modules , use of __init__.py file.Also how to create a module using folder and also using the files. difference between import and from keywords.
import statement
from statement
difference between import and from statement
importance of __init__.py file
